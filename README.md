# OpenGoodLuck
This is a very indev game engine, run with OpenGL, GLM, GLAD, and other various smaller libraries like stb_image (and tinyobjloader eventually). As a high school dev, I doubt this will go very far, as game engines are a very complex application requiring hardware knowledge and skills on the full stack, as well as copius amounts of details about C++ itself. Being truly proficient in none, progress is slow. However, I still have an outline for the project below if you'd like to stick around for the long haul.

## Goals
The eventual "get it out the door" stage is to simply have enough features to haphazardly make a very small game, or animation if that prooves too difficult. In the end, it is a rendering platform more than it is a game engine. I would like to add I only intend on making this a 3D engine. 2D games aren't my thing. Also, my philosophy is basically "if the PS1 had a feature, my engine should too," so that includes vertex lighting, in-engine light baking, textures, and collisions. Things like in-game GUI will be a later me issue, or a never me issue. In the end, I'm mostly making this to learn about 3D graphics and full-stack for games, so there really is no reason to add a feature like that, as it is pretty much just interactable images when you get down to it.

TLDR,
### Rendering
- Textures
- Vertex & texture-baked lighting
- Rudimentary collisions
### Game
- Objects (static)
- Objects (dynamic)
- Entities (pcc & npc)
### Other
- Class abstractions to make game making easier.
- No, there will NEVER be a gui for creating the game itself.

Expect none of this to happen. One can only hope my motivation stays solid and my teachers don't space out my tests.
